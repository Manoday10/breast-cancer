# Breast-Cancer-Detection


We propose a method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin-stained breast biopsy images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our method classifies images into four categories: normal tissue, benign lesion, in situ carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma, as well as a binary classification of carcinoma and non-carcinoma. The network architecture is meticulously designed to extract information at various scales, encompassing both individual nuclei and the overall tissue organization. This design enables the seamless integration of our proposed system with whole-slide histology images. Our method achieves an accuracy of 84.8% for the four-class classification and demonstrates a sensitivity of 95.6% for cancer cases.
